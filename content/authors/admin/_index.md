I'm a 5th year PhD student at the Northwestern University Department of Economics. In my dissertation, I study interactions between the Chinese government and firms, with a focus on contractors implementing Chinese foreign aid projects in developing countries. Find out more about this and my other research below.

I also enjoy teaching statistics and applied econometrics with a focus on causal inference. Prior to my PhD, I worked in finance for several years and got a taste of the Swiss diplomatic service in Southeast Asia.
