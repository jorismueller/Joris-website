abstract: "The efficacy of foreign aid, especially when given to satisfy the objectives of the donor country, is highly controversial. I study this question in the context of Chinese infrastructure aid, which has received much attention from policy makers. I build a novel project and firm-level dataset to identify determinants of Chinese aid and its economic consequences for recipient countries. I document that when there is local labor unrest in China, contracts for Chinese aid projects are given to state-owned firms in the area to boost employment. Connections between these firms and other countries mean that China's political need to moderate domestic unrest also affects the allocation of Chinese aid to other countries. I exploit the variation in the receipt of aid caused by the timing and spatial variation in local labor unrest in China to develop an instrument for estimating the causal effects of Chinese aid on recipient countries. I find large positive effects on GDP, consumption, employment and diplomatic relations."
