abstract: "The goals and impacts of trillions of dollars in foreign aid are highly mixed and debated. Can aid promote development even when donors provide it to pursue their own interests? I study China, a prominent but poorly understood donor, to make progress on this question. I build a novel contract- and firm-level dataset to identify the mechanism behind a domestic political goal driving China's aid allocation. I show that the Chinese government gives aid in the form of infrastructure to other countries to generate employment for Chinese workers in response to local unrest in China. Connections between specific Chinese firms and other countries mean that variation in unrest in China also influences the timing and recipients of aid. This generates an instrument to estimate the causal effects of such aid on recipient countries. I find large positive effects on GDP, consumption and employment. The results show that domestic political needs drive a significant share of Chinese foreign aid. However, this does not undermine the benefits of such aid to recipients."
