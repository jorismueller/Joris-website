abstract: "The efficacy of foreign aid, especially when given to satisfy the objectives of the donor country, is highly controversial. I study this question in the context of Chinese infrastructure aid, which has received much attention from policy makers. I build a novel project- and firm-level dataset to identify the determinants of Chinese infrastructure aid and its economic consequences for recipient countries. I document that the Chinese government gives infrastructure aid projects to other countries to generate employment for Chinese workers in response to local labor unrest in China. I exploit the time and country variation in the receipt of Chinese aid caused by the timing and spatial variation in local labor unrest to develop an instrument for estimating the causal effects of Chinese aid on recipient countries. I find large positive effects on GDP, consumption and employment."
