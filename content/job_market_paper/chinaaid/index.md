abstract: "Trillions of dollars in foreign aid have failed to achieve broad-based economic development. Are strategic objectives by donor countries to blame? I study China, a prominent but poorly understood donor, to make progress on this question. I build a novel contract- and firm-level dataset to identify the mechanism behind a domestic political objective driving China's aid allocation. I show that the Chinese government gives aid to other countries to generate employment for Chinese workers in response to local unrest in China. Connections between specific Chinese firms and recipients of aid mean that variation in unrest in China also influences the timing and recipients of aid. This generates a shift-share IV to estimate the effects of politically-motivated aid on recipient countries. I find positive, economically significant effects on GDP, consumption and employment. The results show that domestic political objectives drive Chinese foreign aid. However, this does not undermine the benefits of Chinese aid to recipients, challenging the prevalent view that aid driven by strategic motives is necessarily ineffective or even harmful."
