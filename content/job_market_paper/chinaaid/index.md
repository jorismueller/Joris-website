abstract: "Trillions of dollars in foreign aid have failed to achieve broad-based economic development. Are economic and political objectives by donor countries to blame? I study China, a prominent but poorly understood donor, to make progress on this question. I build a novel contract- and firm-level dataset to identify the mechanism behind a domestic political objective driving China's aid allocation. I show that the Chinese government gives aid to other countries to generate employment for Chinese workers in response to local unrest in China. Connections between specific Chinese firms and other countries mean that variation in unrest in China also influences the timing and recipients of aid. This generates a novel IV to estimate the causal effects of such aid on recipient countries. I find large positive effects on GDP, consumption and employment. The results show that domestic political needs drive a significant fraction of Chinese foreign aid. However, this does not undermine the benefits of aid to recipients."
