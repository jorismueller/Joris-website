abstract: "This project documents the rise of the Chinese Communist Party’s influence on
firms in China over the last decade. We propose novel quantitative measures of Party
influence and present recent trends in those measures. We corroborate qualitative work
and find a sharp increase in Party influence since 2017. Furthermore, we find that in-
fluence has been concentrated in state-owned firms. Domestic private and foreign firms
exhibit much lower overall levels of influence, most of which is rhetorical.
