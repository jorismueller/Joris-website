abstract: "China has recently become the largest provider of official finance to developing countries. I link project-level data with administrative firm-level data from China to identify political determinants and economic consequences of Chinese foreign aid. I document that when there is labor unrest in a Chinese prefecture, contracts for infrastructure aid projects are allocated to state-owned firms in the prefecture, and employment by these firms increases. Connections between these firms and other countries mean that China's response to domestic unrest affects the allocation of Chinese aid projects to recipient countries. I exploit this variation to develop a novel instrument for identifying the causal effects of Chinese aid on recipients. I find large positive short-term and small long-term effects on GDP, consumption and employment. <br/>
