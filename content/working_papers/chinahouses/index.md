abstract: "Wealthy foreign real estate buyers have increased rapidly over the past few decades. Of particular note are those from China; in 2016 alone, Chinese buyers were the source of over 100 billion USD of outflows to foreign real estate markets. This paper investigates the effect that these wealthy Chinese buyers have on local US housing markets. Using a novel instrument, the paper demonstrates that an increase in the share of wealthy Chinese buyers in a locality causes an increase in house price growth. As a result of this increased growth, local governments benefit from increased property tax revenues, but do not see a drop in sales tax revenues, suggesting that the vacancy rate for wealthy Chinese is not actually different from counterfactual buyers, while a drop in rental prices suggests that wealthy Chinese are more likely to rent out their houses and less likely to move into them."
