abstract: "Establishing national identity has been a challenge in building and maintaining strong states throughout history. Scholarly interest in this topic has grown since the end of World War II, as large numbers of countries gained their independence from colonial powers and set about building new states. Understanding the processes through which national identity is developed and maintained is plagued by numerous empirical challenges, however, both in terms of data paucity and establishing causality. In this paper we make progress toward overcoming these challenges by studying a historical policy experiment in  Tanzania. Between 1970 and 1981, Tanzania engaged in one of the largest nation-building exercises in post-colonial Africa, forcing much of the country's multi-ethnic rural population to live together in developmental villages. Forced coexistence was accompanied by dramatic expansions in access to primary school and changes to the public school curriculum - including the use of political education as a nation-building tool. The extent of forced coexistence was not uniform, however, allowing us to combine differences across districts in its intensity with differences across school cohorts induced by the timing of the project. We show persistent effects of forced coexistence on national identity and ethnic intermarriage among cohorts who were of public primary school age during this period. Treated cohorts are also more likely to express support for a strong, central state and are less likely to speak out and question authority. These findings speak to the trade-offs contemporary nations face in establishing effective and well-governed multi-ethnic states."

summary: "We study one of the largest historical policy experiments in post-colonial Africa and its persistent effects on nation-building."
