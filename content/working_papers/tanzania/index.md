abstract: "*Draft under revision*  <br/>
Ethnic heterogeneity poses a fundamental challenge to state-building. We study the long-term effects of one of the largest state-building exercises in post-colonial Africa, the Tanzanian \emph{Ujamaa} policy. The policy's core aim included creating a national identity and establishing the state's legitimacy in a highly ethnically diverse population. The policy mandated the population to live in planned villages, where children of schooling age were exposed to public education that served the government's goal. We combine differences in the exposure to \emph{Ujamaa} across space and across age cohorts to identify the effect of the policy. We show persistent, positive effects on national identity and on views of the state. We observe no systematic changes among cohorts that were above or below treatment age during \emph{Ujamaa}. Our preferred interpretation, supported by evidence that considers alternative hypotheses, is that changes to the educational content drive our findings. Moreover, while the policy contributed to building a strong national identity among exposed cohorts, it led to a persistent decrease in their demands for democratic accountability."
