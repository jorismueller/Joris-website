abstract: "Leaders throughout history have understood the importance of national identity for governing societies effectively. However, the extent to which leaders can shape identity through policy is an open question. Finding answers to this question has been hindered by a lack of subnational variation in relevant policies, data paucity, and identification challenges. We confront these challenges in a context where the question is especially salient: the founding of new, multi-ethnic states in post-colonial Africa. We study the Ujamaa reforms in Tanzania in 1970–1981, which comprise one of the largest policy experiments aimed at building national identity. These reforms dramatically expanded access to and altered the content of public education. Access expanded primarily through villagization, which forced much of the country’s multi-ethnic rural population to live together in villages administered by the national government. We combine differences in the intensity of villagization across districts with differences across school cohorts induced by the timing of the policy in order to identify the effect of Ujamaa education on citizens’ identification with the nation. We show persistent, positive effects on national identity as measured both by survey responses and ethnic intermarriage. Treated cohorts are also more likely to express support for a strong, central state and less likely to question authority."
