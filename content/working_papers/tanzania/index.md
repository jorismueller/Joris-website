abstract: "This paper examines the state-building process in multi-ethnic societies. Specifically, we study the Ujamaa policy in Tanzania from 1970--1981, one of the largest policy experiments in post-colonial Africa aimed at building a national identity among the population and establishing the new post-independence state as a legitimate authority. The policy brought much, but not all of the country's population to live in planned villages, where children were exposed to public education whose content reflected the new government's political goals. We combine differences in the intensity of villagization across districts with differences in the exposure to the timing of the policy across age cohorts to identify the effect of the Ujamaa policy on citizens' attitudes. We show persistent, positive effects on national identity, as measured by survey responses and inter-ethnic marriage decisions. Treated cohorts are less likely to demand democratic accountability: they express positive views for a strong central state and question less state authority."
