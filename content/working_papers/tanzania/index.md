abstract: "This paper examines the state-building process in an important but poorly understood context: the founding of new, multi-ethnic states in post-colonial Africa. We study the Ujamaa reforms in Tanzania in 1970--1981, one of the largest policy experiments in recent history aimed at building national identity and establishing the central state as a legitimate authority. The reforms dramatically altered the nature of public education by changing the content of the curriculum and expanding access to schooling. To implement the reforms, the Tanzanian government used a concurrent policy, known as villagization, which forced much of the country's population to live together in government administrated villages. We combine differences in intensity of villagization across districts with differences across school cohorts, induced by the timing of the policy, to identify the effect of Ujamaa on citizens' attitudes. We show persistent, positive effects on citizens' identification with the nation, as measured both by survey responses and ethnic intermarriage. Treated cohorts are also more likely to express positive views for a strong central state and less likely to question state authority."
