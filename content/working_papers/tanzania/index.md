abstract: "*New draft coming soon*  <br/>
Diversity poses fundamental challenges to state-building and governance. We study the long-term effects of one of post-colonial Africa's largest state-building exercises  — the Tanzanian Ujamaa policy — which aimed to address these challenges. Ujamaa aimed at creating a national identity and establishing state legitimacy by mandating a highly diverse population to live in planned villages where children received political education. We combine differences in the exposure to Ujamaa across space and age cohorts to identify the policy's impact. We show persistent, positive effects on national identity based on surveys and inter-ethnic marriages. We observe no systematic changes among cohorts that were above or below treatment-age during Ujamaa. Our preferred interpretation, supported by evidence that considers alternative hypotheses, is that changes to educational content drive our findings. Moreover, while Ujamaa contributed to establishing the new Tanzanian state as a legitimate central authority, this came at the expense of demands for democratic accountability."
